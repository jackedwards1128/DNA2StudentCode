| Oct 15  | 10:05 | I am currently thinking through possible strategies that I could implement to search through the sequence quickly. My first thought was to run a quick benchmark to gauge the scale of this data. I coded a loop to count how many 'A's there are in the sequence and return it. Chromosome22 took 650 milliseconds to do this. This actually isn't as awful as I was expecting, so I'm going to start by coding a traditional approach. I'm going to check every char until I hit the first letter of a STR, and then I'll check the next letter with the str, and terminate if it doesn't match. Okay I just finished a rough verison of my linear search that doesn't include edge cases. I suprisingly got Chromosome22 correct in only 700ms! I had a nice conversation with Mr. Blick about breaking the data into 2-bit chunks, which allows me to compare 4 base pairs at once. Mr. Blick told me about GPU's ability to parallel task |
