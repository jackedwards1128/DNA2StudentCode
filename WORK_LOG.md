| Oct 15 |  10:05  | I am currently thinking through possible strategies that I could implement to search through the sequence quickly. My first thought was to run a quick benchmark to gauge the scale of this data. I coded a loop to count how many 'A's there are in the sequence and return it. Chromosome22 took 650 milliseconds to do this. This actually isn't as awful as I was expecting, so I'm going to start by coding a traditional approach. I'm going to check every char until I hit the first letter of a STR, and then I'll check the next letter with the str, and terminate if it doesn't match. Okay I just finished a rough verison of my linear search that doesn't include edge cases. I suprisingly got Chromosome22 correct in only 700ms! I had a nice conversation with Mr. Blick about breaking the data into 2-bit chunks, which allows me to compare 4 base pairs at once. Mr. Blick told me about GPU's ability to parallel task |

I discussed with Logan about the optimal way to do things, as we were using different implemntations of the same searching idea. I ended this block with code that worked perfectly ignoring the edge case in which the start of an STR is overlooked due to the characters immediately preceeding it resembling the start of the STR. |

All I had to do was decrement i when an STR search failed but got past the first letter. I simply had to decrement by the amount of letters "deep" the algorithm had gotten into the STR. I'm happy with this code, it finishes all tests in 1.2 seconds on my machine. I'll look over things to see if I can optimize (which I may not be able to, I feel like I coded this pretty dense) |
