My first thought was to run a quick benchmark to gauge the scale of this data. I coded a loop to count how many 'A's there are in the sequence and return it. Chromosome22 took 650 milliseconds to do this. This actually isn't as awful as I was expecting, so I'm going to start by coding a traditional approach. I'm going to check every char until I hit the first letter of a STR, and then I'll check the next letter with the str, and terminate if it doesn't match. Okay I just finished a rough verison of my linear search that doesn't include edge cases. I suprisingly got Chromosome22 correct in only 700ms! I had a nice conversation with Mr. Blick about breaking the data into 2-bit chunks, which allows me to compare 4 base pairs at once. Mr. Blick told me about GPU's ability to parallel task |

I discussed with Logan about the optimal way to do things, as we were using different implemntations of the same searching idea. I ended this block with code that worked perfectly ignoring the edge case in which the start of an STR is overlooked due to the characters immediately preceeding it resembling the start of the STR. |

All I had to do was decrement i when an STR search failed but got past the first letter. I simply had to decrement by the amount of letters "deep" the algorithm had gotten into the STR. I'm happy with this code, it finishes all tests in 1.2 seconds on my machine. I'll look over things to see if I can optimize (which I may not be able to, I feel like I coded this pretty dense) |
|        |         | Okay, I think my code is efficient so I'm going to try to take a stab at the parallel comparison idea that I had during tutorial while talking to you. I feel like I could turn the String into a bunch of ints, each have 4 bytes which means each int could store 16 nucleotides. However, how could I check for multiple nucleotides at once? Of course, if our STR was ACTG, and the byte of the sequence in question was 00,01,10,11 (assuming order of pairs is actg when assigning values to them), then we know that byte is ACTG. However, the A could've started on the second pair of bits in the byte, and then the G would be in the next byte over. Basically, we can't ensure that our STR will line up with how we divide our bytes. Okay I have an idea. So suppose that we can encode our bits representing the data in a long stream (not split up across different int/byte variables). Then, you compare the last two digits of the stream with the first letter of the STR, until you find a match. To scroll along the stream we can use bitwise operators. Then, once a match is found, suppose our STR is 4 nucleotides long, we can just compare the last 8 bits of our stream with the value of our STR. if it matches, we can use a bitwise operator to chop that WHOLE part off. Unfortunately, my night is pretty busy tonight, and I also know nothing about actually implementing bit-level data. I tried to do this to encode my ultra-optimized tiny tree for SpellCheck v1, and I just couldn't figure out how to do all this with bits and bytes and stuff at the level of 1s and 0s. So I hope to expand my toolkit next A block! Huzzah |
